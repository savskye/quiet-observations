    <p><strong>Digital minimalism</strong> poses as a form of resistance—but for the privileged, opting out was never radical. It was always an option.</p>
  
    <p>This mini essay explores how the trend of digital detox is deeply intertwined with class dynamics.</p>
  
    <p>The resistance at the heart of digital minimalism rests on a belief: that we can reclaim control from systems designed to profit from our chronic digital suffering. But this ability to resist assumes a certain kind of stability—financial, social, and psychological.</p>
  
    <p>For those raised with access to private space, supportive communities, and non-digital alternatives for learning, connection, and entertainment, digital minimalism can feel natural—effortless, even. For others, especially those who rely on technology for work, education, or social inclusion, disconnecting can feel more like exclusion than liberation.</p>
  
    <p>The choice to log off is easiest when doing so doesn’t threaten your livelihood or social belonging. In this sense, digital minimalism is not just a personal lifestyle decision—it reflects deeper systemic disparities.</p>
  
    <p>Though it can be a powerful tool to reclaim attention and agency, digital minimalism is increasingly becoming yet another form of self-improvement inaccessible to many because of persistent class divides.</p>
